	<summary>The movie is told as a dual narrative, with Farhan narrating the flashbacks of ICE while he, Raju, and Chatur try to find Rancho.

		In their first year of college, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi join the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi and meet Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad aka Rancho, their roommate, who is passionate about experimenting with different things, and consequently tops the class. Rancho's carefree approach to education results in him being at odds with the college's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed "Virus" by the students), who believes in a strict and competitive education system.
		
		When a student named Joy Lobo commits suicide after failing to meet a project deadline, Rancho confronts Virus about the extreme pressure placed on ICE students but is rudely rebuffed. One night, the trio gatecrash a wedding and meet Virus' youngest daughter, Pia, only later realizing that the wedding is for Pia's older sister, Mona. An infuriated Virus warns Farhan and Raju about the effects of them being friends with Rancho by pointing out the modest financial situations of their families, scaring Raju into bunking with Chatur "Silencer" Ramalingam, a competitive, arrogant student who believes in learning by rote memorization. To teach Chatur a lesson about memorization, Rancho and Farhan make obscene modifications in Chatur's teacher's day speech by changing certain words (like Chamatkar (Miracle) to Balatkar (Screw) and Dhan (Money) to Stan (Bosom)), leading to a furious Chatur to make a bet with Rancho to see who will be more successful in 10 years.</summary>
		
		The night before their final exams, Raju's paralyzed father experiences a medical emergency and Rancho rushes him to the hospital on Pia's scooter with her help. After realizing that Rancho saved his father's life, Raju reconciles with him. At the end of the year, Rancho comes first in the class, while Farhan and Raju are last and second last, respectively. At the yearly class photo, Rancho makes a bet with Virus that if either Raju or Farhan gets a job from on-campus interviews, Virus will shave his mustache.</summary>
